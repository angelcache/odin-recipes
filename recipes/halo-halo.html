    <p>Halo-halo (meaning "mix-mix" in Filipino) is a colorful and refreshing Filipino dessert made with a blend of crushed ice, sweetened fruits, jellies, beans, and other local delicacies, all layered in a tall glass. It's topped with leche flan, ube halaya (purple yam jam), and a scoop of ice cream, then drizzled with evaporated milk. Meant to be stirred together before eating, halo-halo offers a delightful mix of textures and flavors — cold, creamy, chewy, and sweet — perfect for beating the tropical heat.</p>
